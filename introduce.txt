So, first:
- The purpose of testing is verification, validation and error detection (in order to find and fix the problems)

– Verification is checking for conformance and consistency by evaluating the results against pre-specified requirements. (Verification: Are we building the system right?)

– Validation is the process of checking that what has been specified is what the user actually wanted. (Validation: Are we building the right system?)

– Error Detection: finding if things happen when they shouldn’t or things don’t happen when they should.
